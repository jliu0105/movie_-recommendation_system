## Introduction 
A Boltzmann Machine is a type of stochastic recurrent neural network that can learn and represent complex patterns in data. This recommendation system uses a Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) for collaborative filtering to predict user ratings and recommend movies to users accord to the given data.

### Features 
* Personalized movie recommendations for users
* Ability to handle large datasets with many users and items
* Collaborative filtering with Restricted Boltzmann Machines
* Easy-to-use command line interface

## Requirement
* Python 3.0 +
* Numpy
* Pandas
* TensorFlow
* Scikit-learn

## Installation
```bash
